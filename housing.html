        <h2 style="font-size: 72px;">Survey</h2>
        <div class="text-area">
          <p>The venue we have chosen provides lodging and meals for the whole weekend for one all inclusive price.  The good part is that the cost per participant is very reasonable.  The awkward part is that we have to figure out how to divide people up between cabins and how much to ask you to pay us back.</p>
          <p>We have enough beds for everyone to stay on site, but not quite enough rooms for every party to get their own private room.  We also understand that some of you may prefer other options.  The main reason that we are sending this survey out so early is that we anticipate one of the best alternative lodging options (Lake Crescent Lodge) will quickly fill up when they allow bookings, one year in advance.</p>
          <p>We are happy to be able to provide meals for the whole weekend (3 breakfasts, 2 lunches and 1 dinner, plus the rehearsal and reception dinners which we are covering) for $60 per person, regardless of whether you stay at Naturebridge's campus.</p>
          <h3>Naturebridge</h3>
          <p>The seven main cabins (Raccoon, Orchid, Crescent, Osprey, Ouzel, Beardslee, and Chanterelle) are heated and air conditioned, and are clustered around a gazebo and central bath house.  They have two, four or six rooms per cabin, each with 6 beds.  Three of them also include an in-cabin full bathroom.</p>
          <p>There are also six smaller, historic cabins (Honeysuckle, Redwing, Dreamerie, Alabam, Summerie, and Valerie).  These are more varied in layout, but all include either a full or half bathroom.</p>

          <h3>Lake Crescent Lodge</h3>
          <p>While we hope that most of you will stay with us at Naturebridge, we understand that the lodging may be a bit too rustic for some.  Another option is <a href="https://www.olympicnationalparks.com/lodging/lake-crescent-lodge/">Lake Crescent Lodge</a>, which is a 10 minute walk away.  Note that we anticipate that their rooms will fill up quickly when they become available one year in advance (seeing that it's a holiday weekend, we would not be surprised if they were fully booked the day that bookings became available).  If you want to stay at Lake Crescent Lodge, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING YOUR RESERVATION.  We do still encourage you to fill out the survey below so that we know that you won't need housing at Naturebridge.</p>
          <h3>Other Options</h3>
          <p>You are welcome to explore the possibility of camping at <a href="https://shadowmountainrvpark.com/">Shadow Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.olympicnationalparks.com/rv-camping/log-cabin-rv-campground/">Log Cabin RV &amp; Campground</a> (across the lake), or <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/camping.htm">Fairholme Campground</a> (first-come-first-served).</p>
          <p>There are also hotels in Port Angeles, half an hour away.</p>
