You can see a bunch of images from that trip <a href="https://gallery.forthrightphoto.com/-allisondavid/gallery">here</a>.

            <p>David noticed Allison’s OKCupid profile in August 2019 and initiated an exchange about dogs and board games – no wonder Allison responded right away! Our first date was in Harvard square at Beat Brew Hall and included a game of Ticket to Ride, foreshadowing the hundreds of board games to come. Our second date included arepas, a concert, ice cream and stories lasting far past when Allison usually slept. It didn't take long to get outside though: this picture is from our first backpacking trip together. The loop had great foliage and traversed a river with an abundance of waterfalls.</p>

After a few dogless months, our pandemic puppy, Merlin, joined the coterie. He showed an early love of chewing stick-like objects and had to learn to love peanut butter; we could tell he was a special pup and we were lucky to have him join our family.</p>

          <h3>Housing</h3>
          <p>We're really excited to offer everyone the opportunity to stay on site and spend the entire weekend together.  Naturebridge accomodations are a combination of standard and historic cabins, with bunk beds and a combination of private, semi-private and bathhouse restrooms.  As part of booking the venue, we were required to book all of their accomodations for the whole weekend.  If you stay at Naturebridge with us, you will need to pay for your weekend food and housing after you <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>.  If you choose to sleep elsewhere but still dine with the gang, we would love to have you; you can commit to this option with your <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a> as well.</p>
          <p>If you prefer more traditional accomodations, Lake Crescent Lodge is a 10 minute walk/2 minute drive away.  They no longer have availability on their website, but if you contact us we know of some rooms that are available.</p>
          <p>Regardless of where you stay, we are pleased to be able to offer everyone meals for the whole duration of the weekend for $60 per person.</p>
          <!--
          <p>In order to help us organize lodging, we'd like your input on what housing options you prefer.  Please fill out <a target="_blank" href="housing.html">our housing survey</a>, even if you're not sure yet whether you can attend.  This will help us promise people rooms of the types they're interested in or advise them to book elsewhere.</p>

          <h3>Getting to the Olympics</h3>
          <h4>Airport</h4>
          <p>The best airport to fly into is Seattle-Tacoma (SEA), which is a 2:45 drive from the venue.</p>
          <h4>Carpooling</h4>
          <p>There are no good public transit options for getting to the park: a combination of Greyhound and city buses takes over eleven hours.  We will help organize carpools for those interested.</p>
          <h4>Timing</h4>
          <p>Before buying flights, we encourage you to consider whether you want to spend more time in the area before or after the wedding.  There are wonderful backpacking opportunities in the Olympics (which we intend to partake of starting on the morning of July 5).  We will be watching fireworks in Port Angeles on the 4th and you're more than welcome to stick around and join us.  Please let us know if you're interested!</p>

          <h3>Attendees</h3>
          <h4>Can I bring a guest?</h4>
          <p>You are welcome to bring a plus-one, but please let us know!</p>
          <h4>Are kids welcome?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely!  We anticipate 15-20 kids under 12 and a few teenagers.  The same way that we hope to schedule fun activities for our adult guests, we welcome ideas for the under-18 crowd.  One thing we are considering is running movie nights after dinner.  We have a building that we're intending to use mostly for kids, and are happy to help parents organize a rotating kid-watching schedule so that they can enjoy other activities.</p>
          <h4>Can I bring pets?</h4>
          <p>NatureBridge does not allow pets in any of the buildings. Dogs can be on leash on the campus and on certain designated trails, but none of the major trails.  If the weather is good, we anticipate that much of the activity will be outside, so please talk to us if you'd like to bring a pet and stay elsewhere.</p>
          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <h4>How are you planning on addressing the pandemic?</h4>
          <p>For everyone's peace of mind, we ask that all guests over 5 receive covid vaccines at least two weeks before attending our wedding.  This is very important to us.</p>
          <p>The venue is also requiring that we send everyone a survey shortly before the event with questions about covid symptoms.</p>
          <h4>What is the weather like in the park in July?</h4>
          <p>Average highs in early July are in the low 70s, with average lows in the high 40s.  However, the weather can be unpredictable.  Be sure to bring layers so you will be prepared for all kinds of weather, especially if you intend on hiking.  There will be snow at higher elevations on hikes.  Sunrise will be around 5:20am and sunset around 9:20pm.</p>
          <h3>Venue</h3>
          <h4>How do I make hotel reservations?</h4>
          <p>If you have no changes to your housing needs and are staying with us at NatureBridge, no worries! We'll have your cabin or bunk assignment waiting when you arrive for check in.  If you were planning to stay off-site (<a href="https://www.olympicnationalparks.com/lodging/lake-crescent-lodge/">Lake Crescent</a>, camping at <a href="https://shadowmountainrvpark.com/">Shadow Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.olympicnationalparks.com/rv-camping/log-cabin-rv-campground/">Log Cabin RV &amp; Campground</a> across the lake, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/camping.htm">Fairholme Campground</a> or in Port Angeles), please make your reservations soon. We hear the 2022 wedding season is filling up fast.</p>
          <p>As a reminder about the options on Naturebridge's campus, the seven main cabins (Raccoon, Orchid, Crescent, Osprey, Ouzel, Beardslee, and Chanterelle) are heated and air conditioned, and are clustered around a gazebo and central bath house.  They have two, four or six rooms per cabin, each with 6 beds.  Three of them also include an in-cabin full bathroom.</p>
          <p>There are also six smaller, historic cabins (Honeysuckle, Redwing, Dreamerie, Alabam, Summerie, and Valerie).  These are more varied in layout, but all include either a full or half bathroom.</p>
          <p>If your housing needs have changed, feel free to submit another <a target="_blank" href="housing.html">housing survey</a> or get in touch with us.  We have seen that Lake Crescent Lodge shows no availability Fourth of July weekend on their website.  However, if you would like to make reservations there, let us know. We know of a few extra rooms which may be available.</p>
          <h4>When can I check in and out?</h4>
          <p>If you are staying at Naturebridge, check in will be at 2:30 pm on Friday July 1st and you will need to check out of your room by 10 am on Monday July 4th.  You will be able to stay on campus until 1 pm on the 4th.</p>
          <h4>Will there be wifi and cell service?</h4>
          <p>Free wireless internet is available in the main buildings, but it can be intermittent. AT&amp;T wireless devices generally work on campus and Verizon has been occasionally spotty. An emergency landline phone is located in the Fireside Room in Rosemary Inn.</p>
          <h4>What do I need to bring to stay in the cabins?</h4>
          <p>Generally, you would need to bring what you would to a stay at a hostel. NatureBridge will provide flat sheet, fitted sheet, pillow, pillowcase, blanket/sleeping bag and a bath towel (various sizes). There is a coin operated washer and dryer in the men's side of the bath house. Guests will need to bring washcloths, soap, shampoo, and hair dryers. If you remember your college days and will be using the bathhouse or a hall bath, you might want to bring flip flops, a robe, and a tote of some sort to carry items to and from the showers.</p>
          <h4>Do the rooms have closets to hang formal clothes?</h4>
          <p>Unfortunately not, but most rooms have extra beds that you can lay things out on.</p>
          <h4>Will we have control over the temperature in our rooms?</h4>
          <p>The standard cabins have a single central thermostat, so you should plan accordingly if you tend to run hotter or colder than most people.  The historic cabins have wall heaters.</p>
          <h4>What is the plan for other meals during the weekend?</h4>
          <p>Besides our rehearsal and reception dinners, guests will be provided 3 breakfasts (omelettes, French toast, pancakes), 2 lunches (sandwiches), 1 additional dinner (pizza).</p>
          <p>Meals are served buffet style in the dining hall at pre-arranged times</p>
          <p>Naturebridge staff will wash dishes, but you will be responsible for bringing your own dishes to the dish tubs near the kitchen.</p>
          <p>They can accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten and dairy-free special requests.</p>
          <p>A refrigerator will be available near the kitchen to store small items of food.  There is also an ice machine available for our use.</p>
          <h4>Can I camp?</h4>
          <p>Unfortunately, Olympic National Park only allows camping in designated areas. The NatureBridge campus is not a designated camping area and therefore, RVs and tents are not allowed. The closest campgrounds are Fairholme Campground (approximately 6 – 8 miles west of campus on Hwy 101), Shadow Mountain (approximately 6 – 8 miles east of campus on Hwy 101), and Log Cabin Resort campground (approximately 8 miles from campus on East Beach Road.)</p>
          <h4>Does the National Park impose any other restrictions?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>No candles indoors</li>
            <li>No helium balloons</li>
            <li>No throwing rice or birdseed</li>
            <li>No fireworks or sparklers</li>
            <li>Garbage and cigarette butts need to be disposed in a waste container</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Activities</h3>
          <h4>What should I do if I think of an awesome activity that I want to run?</h4>
          <p>Fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/7qAUXM9FPVpV5m577">activity signup</a> and let us know!  There's no commitment yet, since we'll reach out as we create a schedule.  Of course, you're also welcome to organize impromptu events once the weekend arrives as well.</p>
          <h4>Will there be activites for kids?</h4>
          <p>Yes!  Whether you're a parent or not, you're welcome to <a href="https://forms.gle/7qAUXM9FPVpV5m577">organize</a> activites that kids might be interested in.  We're planning on using the classroom building for kids events.</p>
          <h4>Will there be canoeing?</h4>
          <p>Yes!  Two Naturebridge educators will be running canoe trips in their 17 person canoes both Saturday and Sunday.  There will be an opportunity to sign up in June when the schedule of events is posted.</p>
          <h4>Is there anything I should bring to make the weekend more fun?</h4>
          <p>Feel free to add items, either those you're planning on bringing to share or those you hope someone else might bring, to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAnPvMCliWW4oKy7ortmrRnKp1fdkyvMjemFtxZS6bE/edit?usp=sharing">communal spreadsheet</a>.  Note that content posted there is publicly viewable, so don't include anything sensitive!</p>
          <h3>Ceremony &amp; Reception</h3>
          <h4>When will the ceremony be?</h4>
          <p>5pm on Sunday, July 3.</p>
          <h4>Who is in your wedding party?</h4>
          <p>We have decided that since we have a matching set of siblings, we’ll each have our brother and sister stand up with us during the ceremony.</p>
          <h4>What is the dress code?</h4>
          <p>We hope our guests will take advantage of the wonderful adventures to be had in the National Park.  Part of adventuring is being comfortable and so we ask our guests not to fuss too much over their attire on the day.  To give you some information you can use to decide what to pack, our plan is to have both the ceremony and reception outside, weather permitting. We plan to serve most meals outside if possible. We plan to dress for the ceremony/reception as follows: Allison plans to go full bridal but with some sort of flats, David in slacks and shirt/vest with no tie.  The rest of the weekend, we plan to be wearing shorts/pants/t-shirts/fleeces (depending on weather)</p>
          <h4>Will there be food after the ceremony?</h4>
          <p>We will have a reception dinner after the ceremony, with salmon!  Rosemary chicken and chana masala (vegetarian) options are also available.</p>
          <h4>What will be available to drink?</h4>
          <p>The National Park Service and Washington State have licensing requirements around serving alcohol. We plan to provide a small assortment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages with dinner but do not plan to have alcohol outside of meal times. Coffee and tea will be provided by Naturebridge throughout the weekend.</p>
          <h4>What's the plan for dancing and music?</h4>
          <p>Music is cool, but we're not organizing dancing.</p>
          <h4>Who have you hired to make the wedding awesome?</h4>
          <p>On top of our great venue, we've hired <a href="https://forthrightphoto.com/">Laura and Devon</a> for photography and <a href="https://www.middlenamebakingco.com/">Olivia</a> to make desserts, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Flowersonamoonbeam/">Janie</a> for flowers.  Laura and Devon have already taken a bunch of <a href="https://gallery.forthrightphoto.com/-allisondavid/gallery">pictures of us</a> during a backpacking trip last summer, and we're excited that they'll be taking pictures of you too.</p>
          <h4>What was your runner-up wedding hashtag?</h4>
          <p>Before we settled on #Roeling-down-the-aisle, we were amused by #Allison-got-Davided.</p>
